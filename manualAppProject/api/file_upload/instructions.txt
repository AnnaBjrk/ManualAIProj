Based on your current stack (React frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL on EC2), I'll help you design a solution for PDF uploads. For file storage, Amazon S3 would be the better choice over EC2 because:

1. S3 is specifically designed for object storage and is more cost-effective than storing files on EC2
2. S3 provides better scalability and durability
3. S3 reduces load on your EC2 instance
4. S3 offers built-in CDN capabilities through CloudFront if needed

Here's a proposed solution:



Here's how the solution works:

1. Frontend (React):
   - Provides a drag-and-drop interface for PDF uploads
   - Validates file type (PDF only)
   - Uses presigned URLs for secure direct uploads to S3
   - Shows upload progress and handles errors
   - Confirms upload completion with backend

2. Backend (FastAPI):
   - Generates presigned URLs for secure S3 uploads
   - Tracks uploads in PostgreSQL database
   - Verifies successful uploads
   - Organizes files by user and date

3. Storage:
   - Uses S3 for scalable file storage
   - Files are organized by user ID and date (här vill vi ha fabrikat, modellnummer1 och modellnummer2, olika sätt att identifiera manualen)
   - PostgreSQL tracks metadata and upload status

To implement this solution:

1. Set up an S3 bucket:
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name
   ```

2. Configure CORS on the S3 bucket to allow uploads from your domain:
   ```json (har lagt till både jib.nu och gizmobuddy.online)
   {
     "CORSRules": [
       {
         "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-domain.com"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET", "HEAD"],
         "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
         "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Set up the necessary environment variables in your FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_REGION=your_region
   S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
   ```

4. Run the database migrations to create the file_uploads table.

The solution is secure because:
- Uses presigned URLs for direct S3 uploads
- Implements proper authentication
- Validates file types
- Organizes files by user
- Tracks upload status in database

It's also scalable because:
- S3 handles large files efficiently
- Direct-to-S3 uploads reduce server load
- PostgreSQL handles metadata efficiently
- Files are organized by date and user

Would you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail?
